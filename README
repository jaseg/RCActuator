This is a hex driver board for model aircraft purposes. It consists of an ATTiny2313 microcontroller receiving the classical servo PWM signal on INT0, decoding it (somehow--this thingy is programmable!) and controlling six low-side transistors accordingly. I plan using BC243s which theoretically allow the board to control 6A per channel. The current layout is not planned for usage with a heatsink (unless one wants to mount the transistors on the bottom of the board), but that would not be too advisably anyway since heatsinks are heavy and thus model aircraft should not contain them.
The unused pins of the AVR are accessible via SMD solder pads on the PCB; two status LEDs (one for the avr voltage regulator which is powered by the reciever and one for the power input) may be added at will. The board does act as a distributor rail for the power input (there are no additional terminals needed) and does include a decent buffer cap for the power input.
What this board does NOT include (since that costs much board space and is not needed in most cases) is flyback diodes for the outputs, so if you plan connecting inductive loads (motors, relays etc.) you will need to add these or some other form of protection for the transistors.
The board layout may easily be modified to facilitate high-side switching, then the NPN transistors need to be replaced by PNP types. By using three high-side and three low-side switches, one board may act as three half-bridges (e.g. for bidirectional motor driving), although for space and weight considerations I would suggest to use some specialised driver IC (such as the L298) instead of this board to do this (perhaps I design another board using it sometime, if you have interest, just write me a mail).
Hopefully this provides enough information, please note that I do not assume any liability for anything (crashed models, burnt down stuff, cooked ICs or transistors etc. ;).
